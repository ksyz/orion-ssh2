<p>Orion SSH-2 for Java (formerly Trilead SSH-2 for Java) is a library which implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure Java (minimum required JRE: 1.4.2). It allows one to connect to SSH servers from within Java programs. It supports SSH sessions (remote command execution and shell access), local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, SCP and SFTP. There are no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all crypto functionality is included.</p>
